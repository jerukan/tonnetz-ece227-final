	abstract = {We study the use of Long Short-Term Memory neural networks to the modeling and prediction of music. Approaches to applying machine learning in modeling and prediction of music often apply little, if any, music theory as part of their algorithms. In contrast, we propose an approach which employs minimal music theory to embed the relationships between notes and chord structure explicitly. We extend the Tonnetz lattice, originally developed by Euler to introduce a metric between notes, in order to induce a metric between chords. Multidimensional scaling is employed to embed chords in twenty dimensions while best preserving this music-theoretic metric. We then demonstrate the utility of this embedding in the prediction of the next chord in a musical piece, having observed a short sequence of previous chords. Applying a standard training, test, and validation methodology to a dataset of Bach chorales, we achieve an accuracy rate of 50.4\% on validation data, compared to an expected rate of 0.2\% when guessing the chord randomly. This suggests that using Euler's Tonnetz for embedding provides a framework in which machine learning tools can excel in classification and prediction tasks with musical data.},

Am. 223:120–123, 1970). The feature of his “game” that probably evoked this intensive interest was the discovery of “oscillators” (periodic forms) and “gliders” (translating oscillators). This introductory chapter is for those who are either unfamiliar with the game, or feel that a brief “refresher course” would be appropriate.},

	abstract = {The "Black Atlantic" rhythmic diaspora, be it realized in jazz, blues, gospel, reggae, rock, candomblé, cumbia, hip-hop or whatever, seems to have widespread capacity to facilitate dance, engagement, social interaction, expression and catharsis. This article examines the reasons for this. Black Atlantic rhythm is founded on the idea of groove or feel, which forms a kinetic framework for reliable prediction of events and time pattern communication, its power cemented by repetition and engendered movement. Overlaid on this are characteristic devices that include syncopation, overlay,displacement, off-beat phrasing, polyrhythm/polymeter, hocketing, heterophony, swing, speech-based rhythms, and call-and-response. Using an evolutionary argument, I point out here that nearly all of these have at their heart the establishment of perceptual multiplicity or rivalry, affecting expectation, which acts as either a message or a message enhancement technique (via increased engagement and focusing of attention), or both. The causal path for the remaining devices is based on adopting structures shared with speech, notably prosody, conversational interaction, and narrative. Several examples illustrate how, particularly in jazz and jazz-related forms, extensions and relatively complex creative adaptations of traditional African and African diasporic rhythmic techniques are a natural consequence of a culture of questioning and reflection that encompasses maintenance of historical reference and accommodation to innovation.},
